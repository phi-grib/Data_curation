# Data_curation
Python code for data preparation for modelling:
- handling SMILES of problematic molecules: organometallics, mixtures, peptides.
- data sampling
- data selection

Installation:
* `git clone https://github.com/phi-grib/Data_curation.git`
* `conda activate <working_environment>`
* `cd Data_curation`
* `python setup.py install`

Now you can use the code for automatically curating and classifiying compounds from its structure.
Still under construction.
