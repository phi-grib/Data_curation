# Data_curation

This Data curation tool provides a user-friendly CLI for treating raw data. It classifies the substances passed as input by filtering the SMILES and also applies a pre-processing of those structures to make them available for QSAR modelling.
It can be used in Jupyter Notebook as well, including data selection funcionalities that still need to be implemented in the CLI.


## Installation:

This tool has been designed for Linux. It hasn't been tested for macOS configurations. 
It needs a suitable conda working environment where to be installed. 

* `git clone https://github.com/phi-grib/Data_curation.git`
* `conda activate <working_environment>`
* `cd Data_curation`
* `python setup.py install`

Now you can use the code for automatically curating and classifiying compounds from its structure.
Still under construction.
